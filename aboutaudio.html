      <h1 id="title">ABOUT SPATIAL AUDIO</h1>
      <br>
      <p id="longparagraph">

        In this article, spatial audio will refer to both 5.1 audio system and binaural audio, as by definition, it means any audio system that is greater than 2.1 and that allows the listener to pinpoint the exact direction of where the sound is coming from; left, right, top left, center, etc.<br><br>
  	Spatial audio has recently gained popular thanks to the advent and rapid advancement in the fields of VR and gaming, and its integration with popular media such as YouTube and Facebook. Spatial audio is a result of several generation of experimentations in trying to imitate real-life environment, as we hear sound coming from all (infinite) directions as opposed to only two audio channels. Two of the most popular forms of spatial audio are binaural, which is made for headphones, and surround systems, where the 5.1 belongs to. Despite having fewer than ∞ channels of real life, engineers were able to imitate real life through complex algorithms and clever speakers placement.<br>
  	5.1 initially offered more benefits over binaural as binaural could not track where the listener’s head is turning to, thus failed to capture to immersion of being in a real space. But that gap, is already closing rapidly.  For starters, we can now can use information from our phone compass to track our head movement, and binaural audio is more suitable for most people as it doesn’t require an extravagant setting of speakers nor does it require you to annoy your neighbors with your dozens of loud-speakers. Thanks to the interests and money being poured into VR industry, and gaming, especially the competitive gaming industry, several software for designing spatial audio has emerged for free to the public and has allowed for a wider exposure of the craft to anyone interested.<br><br>
  	In competitive gaming space, such as CSGO, knowing the exact location of your opponent would be of great advantage. But due to some games’ support of only stereo audio, there are companies that sought to turn the stereo output of the game into a quasi-surround-sounding audio. To name a few: Nahimic from msi, Razor surround, Dolby Atmos, Realtek, Audio Royale, etc.<br><br>
  	The spread of surround sound technology, from motion pictures into other fields has indeed brought many new key players to the advancement of the technology. So, would it not then, in this era of audio renaissance, be a waste to not at least leverage the tools available to us now and create something people in the past could not even have dreamt of doing?<br><br>
